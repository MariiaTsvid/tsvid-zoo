// special 420 to 422 intermediate Mitchell-Netravali cubic5 chroma up-sampling
// This shader should not be run as a screen space pixel shader.
// This shader requires compiling with ps_2_0, but higher is better, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_shader to look up what PS version your video card supports.
// If possible, avoid compiling with the software emulation modes (ps_?_sw). Pixel shaders require a lot of processing power to run in real-time software mode.
// If used in combination with other shaders and filters, place this and other Y'CbCr-type shaders at the beginning of the processing chain.
// Use this shader if the 4:2:0 sub-sampled chroma gets up-sampled in hardware by doubling the values, instead of interpolating between them.
// The most notable artifacts produced by this problem are 2-by-2-sized pixel blocks if a red object is next to a dark background.
// You can use the "chroma for SD&HD video input" shader with 200% picture magnification to test. It will make 4-by-4-sized pixel blocks everywhere in the picture if the up-sampling is wrong.
// Use the "special 422 Mitchell-Netravali cubic5 chroma up-sampling and color controls" shader in combination with this shader to finish chroma up-sampling.
// This shader can only use Y'CbCr input.
