// RGB to Y'CbCr for SD&HD video input for integer surfaces
// This shader should not be run as a screen space pixel shader.
// This shader requires compiling with ps_2_0, but higher is better, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_shader to look up what PS version your video card supports.
// If possible, avoid compiling with the software emulation modes (ps_?_sw). Pixel shaders require a lot of processing power to run in real-time software mode.
// This shader will change BT.709 [HD] or BT.601 [SD] derived RGB to Y'CbCr of an image.
