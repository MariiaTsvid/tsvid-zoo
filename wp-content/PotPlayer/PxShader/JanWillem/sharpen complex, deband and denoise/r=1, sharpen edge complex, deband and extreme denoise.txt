// r=1, sharpen edge complex, deband and extreme denoise
// This shader should not be run as a screen space pixel shader.
// This shader requires compiling with ps_2_0, but higher is better, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_shader to look up what PS version your video card supports.
// If possible, avoid compiling with the software emulation modes (ps_?_sw). Pixel shaders require a lot of processing power to run in real-time software mode.
// This shader is meant to work with linear RGB input and output. Regular R'G'B' with a video gamma encoding will have to be converted with the linear gamma shaders to work properly.
// If present, deinterlacing artifacts will become worse with this shader.
// Using at least 10-bit per color component input, processing and output also helps a lot to prevent color banding. The common 8-bit formats will always have banding. For testing the maximum debanding and denoising capacity of this shader, use "r=1 blur".
// Temporal color banding in movies can not be solved without additional frame interpolation processing.
// To test if the detection rules of this shader are correct, you can uncomment the three lines of "float4(?, ?, ?, 0);" and run the shader on a test picture.

// fractions, either decimal or not, are allowed
// NoiseLevel, interval [.5, 4], detection noise factor, .5 is for very plain, lossless, synthetic images, 1 is normal for digital lossy video and images, higher values will help counter grainy noise on surfaces and gradients, at the cost of the detail level
