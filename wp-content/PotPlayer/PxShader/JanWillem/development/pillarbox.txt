// pillarbox
// This shader can be run as a screen space pixel shader.
// This shader requires compiling with ps_2_0, but higher is better, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_shader to look up what PS version your video card supports.
// If possible, avoid compiling with the software emulation modes (ps_?_sw). Pixel shaders require a lot of processing power to run in real-time software mode.
// Use this shader only if you need to add black bars at the left and right of an image.

// fractions, either decimal or not, are allowed
// Ratio, width/height
#define Ratio 4/3.

	return float4(0, 0, 0, 1);// output the black bars of the pillarbox
