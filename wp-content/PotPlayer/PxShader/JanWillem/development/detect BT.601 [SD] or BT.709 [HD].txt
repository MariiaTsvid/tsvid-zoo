// detect BT.601 [SD] or BT.709 [HD]
// This shader can be run as a screen space pixel shader.
// This shader requires compiling with ps_2_0, but higher is better, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_shader to look up what PS version your video card supports.
// If possible, avoid compiling with the software emulation modes (ps_?_sw). Pixel shaders require a lot of processing power to run in real-time software mode.
// This shader will detect HD and SD resolutions.
// The lowest HD resolution frame is defined as 1280×720, aspect ratio 9/16.
// The standard allows up to 1/8 to be lost due to overscan for both width and height; 1280*7/8=1120 & 720*7/8=630
// The lowest aspect ratio is 1/2.40, height is then limited; floor(1120/2.40)=466
// The highest aspect ratio is 3/4=.75, width is then limited; floor(630/.75)=840
// The detection rule for HD must apply for both 1120×466 and 840×630 resolutions.
