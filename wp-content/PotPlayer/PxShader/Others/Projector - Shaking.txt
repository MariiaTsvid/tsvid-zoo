// projector film shaking
// This shader can be run as a screen space pixel shader.
// This shader requires compiling with ps_2_0, but higher is better, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_shader to look up what PS version your video card supports.
// If possible, avoid compiling with the software emulation modes (ps_?_sw). Pixel shaders require a lot of processing power to run in real-time software mode.
// Use this shader to add a shaking effect to a video, similar to the image disalignments with a film projector.

// Shake, interval [8192., 0.]
#define Shake 2560.

	return tex2D(s0, tex);							// output the shifted pixel
