// invert
// This shader can be run as a screen space pixel shader.
// This shader requires compiling with ps_2_0, but higher is better, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_shader to look up what PS version your video card supports.
// If possible, avoid compiling with the software emulation modes (ps_?_sw). Pixel shaders require a lot of processing power to run in real-time software mode.
// This shader is meant to work with linear RGB input and output. Regular R'G'B' with a video gamma encoding will have to be converted with the linear gamma shaders to work properly.
// This shader will make the color negative of an image.
